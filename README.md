## ⚠️⚠️ Repository archival notice ⚠️⚠️

We would like to inform you that this repository has been **archived** and the Bicep landing zone vending module for Azure now has a new home in the [Bicep public registry](https://aka.ms/lz-vending/bicep) and is now a pattern module in the [Azure Verified Modules](https://aka.ms/avm) initiative.

### What does this mean?

- This repository is now in a **read-only** state.
- No further issues, pull requests, or updates will be maintained on this repository.
- All future releases, fixes and improvements will be managed in the new AVM pattern module hosted on the [Bicep public registry](https://aka.ms/lz-vending/bicep).
- We will continue to leverage the [Wiki](https://github.com/azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki) in this repository as the module's additional documentation and guidance location.

### Why was this done?

We are converting this module to be an [Azure Verified pattern module](https://aka.ms/avm) to better align with the [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/concepts/what-why-how/) initiative. This will help us align with the Well-architected framework guidance, have improved [module support](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/module-support/) and provide you with a consistent experience consuming [AVM Bicep modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/).

📒 If you are not familiar with [Azure Verified Modules](https://aka.ms/avm), you can watch the following Youtube videos for a quick overview:

- [An Introduction to Azure Verified Modules (AVM) by the Customer Architecture & Engineering team](https://youtu.be/JbIMrJKW5N0?si=4v69hlyBbINufHEO) 📽️🎬🎞️
- [Azure Verified Modules Overview by John Savill](https://youtu.be/3FeIFHaJOtg?si=ZDXJ3EPwT9Xlzq2P) 📽️🎬🎞️

### If I'm already using the Bicep Subscription vending module from the Bicep public registry, what do I need to change?

We tried as much as possible to have a smooth transition path with minimal breaking changes. To switch to the new module:

- Review the documentation for the [new AVM module](https://aka.ms/lz-vending/bicep).
- Change the module reference in your code to reference `br/public:avm/ptn/lz/sub-vending:x.x.x` instead of `br/public:lz/sub-vending:x.x.x`
- If you have a preference on sharing deployment elemetry for this module, the parameter `disableTelemetry` has been changed to `enableTelemetry`. This change is due to AVM modules mandate the use of this parameter.

> **NOTE:** After the migration to Azure Verified Modules, version `1.5.2` of the Subscription Vending module is now `0.1.0` in the [Bicep public registry](https://aka.ms/lz-vending/bicep).

### Feedback

For any issues, suggestions or feedback for this module, please open an issue on the [Bicep public registry](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/issues).

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

## Overview

> ℹ️ This module requires the usage of Bicep version `v0.11.1` or later. For details on installing/upgrading Bicep see: [Install Bicep tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install) ℹ️
>
> ℹ️ This module is also available on the Bicep Module Registry [here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/ptn/lz/sub-vending). Examples also included in our [wiki examples](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki/examples). ℹ️

The landing zone Bicep modules are designed to accelerate deployment of the individual landing zones (aka Subscriptions) within an Microsoft Entra Tenant.

> See the different types of landing zones in the Azure Landing Zones documentation here: [What is an Azure landing zone? - Platform vs. application landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-vs-application-landing-zones)

The modules are designed to be instantiated many times, once for each desired landing zone.

This is currently split logically into the following capabilities:

- Subscription creation and management group placement
- Networking - deploy a Virtual Network with, optional:
  - Hub & spoke connectivity (peering to a hub Virtual Network)
  - Virtual WAN connectivity (peering to a Virtual Hub via a Virtual Hub Connection)
    - Including support for connections to Virtual WAN Hubs with Routing Intent configured
  - Link to existing DDoS Network Protection Plan
  - Specify Custom DNS Servers
- Role assignments
- Tags
- Resource providers and resource providers features registration

> When creating Virtual Network peerings, be aware of the [limit of peerings per Virtual Network.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-network%2Ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits)

We would like feedback on what's missing in the module. Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/issues) if you have any suggestions.

## Parameters for module `main.bicep`

**Parameters documented here: [`main.bicep.parameters.md`](main.bicep.parameters.md).**

Details on each of the parameters, including examples and an [example parameter file](main.bicep.parameters.md#parameter-file) (this is not a valid parameter file as all parameters contain values, so you must remove the un-required parameters or set them back to their default value, as documented), for the [`main.bicep`](main.bicep) module can be found [here: `main.bicep.parameters.md`](main.bicep.parameters.md).

> These docs are automatically generated using [PSDocs.Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSDocs.Azure) from the Bicep module file itself and [this GitHub Action](.github/workflows/update-bicep-module-docs.yml) as part of PRs that amend this Bicep module.

## Consumer Guide

We have a [Consumer Guide](https://github.com/azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki/consumerguide) available for guidance on how to consume this module.

## Example

> For more examples please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki) and if you cannot find an example you are looking for please [raise an issue](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/issues/new/choose) on the repo 👍

Below is an example showing how to use this module.

Most commonly this module will be deployed using [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/overview), with the [Azure Az Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/what-is-azure-powershell), with a supporting `.json` parameters file, one per landing zone to create/vend. Or the same approach but using the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli).

> **IMPORTANT:** The below example requires you have cloned/downloaded the entire repo and have it available at run-time on the machine running the below commands. It is also expected you are in the root of the cloned/extracted repository; otherwise paths will need to be changed in the below example.

### PowerShell Example

```powershell
$inputObject = @{
  DeploymentName        = 'lz-vend-{0}' -f (-join (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddTHHMMssffffZ')[0..63])
  ManagementGroupId     = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' # Set this to the Management Group ID you wish to target the deployment against. NOTE: This isn't the Management Group that the Subscription will be moved to, that is specified via the parameters.
  Location              = 'uksouth' # Set this to the Azure Region you wish the deployment to be targeted against. NOTE: This isn't the Region that the Subscription's resources will be deployed to, that is specified via the parameters.
  TemplateParameterFile = './landingZones/lz1.parameters.json' # This would be changed to the specific file per landing zone.
  TemplateFile          = "./main.bicep" # Set this to the path where you have checked out this repo to.
}

New-AzManagementGroupDeployment @inputObject
```

### Azure CLI Example

```bash
dateYMD=$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%NZ)
DEPLOYMENTNAME="lz-vend-${dateYMD}"
MANAGEMENTGROUPID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Set this to the Management Group ID you wish to target the deployment against. NOTE: This isn't the Management Group that the Subscription will be moved to, that is specified via the parameters.
LOCATION="uksouth" # Set this to the Azure Region you wish the deployment to be targeted against. NOTE: This isn't the Region that the Subscription's resources will be deployed to, that is specified via the parameters.
TEMPLATEPARAMETERFILE="@/landingZones/lz1.parameters.json" # This would be changed to the specific file per landing zone.
TEMPLATEFILE="/main.bicep" # Set this to the path where you have checked out this repo to.

az deployment mg create --name ${DEPLOYMENTNAME:0:63} --parameters $TEMPLATEPARAMETERFILE --location $LOCATION --management-group-id $MANAGEMENTGROUPID --template-file $TEMPLATEFILE
```
